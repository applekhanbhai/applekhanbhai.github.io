									<p>Interesting time. I was sitting on the hammock thing at hasnat's, all the kids hide behind the bushes/trees, you enter the gate soon after, with ghuncha leading the way. Not really sure what i was thinking when this was happening, but i think i expected it. The kids hiding with those facial expressions kind of made it obvious that they were in on it.</p>
									<br><p>Ghuncha has the opening liner, "She wants to tell you something", pointing towards you. You come a bit closer, and start smiling awkwardly. I sit there acting indifferent, swinging on that thing back and forth. I hear the magic words, "I like you"</p>

									<br><p>My brain goes into overdrive, thinking of the best possible response. It didn't have to be genuine, i didn't have to mean it, it just had to be something that would make everyone there laugh. After thinking for a few seconds, the best response i could come up with......</p>

									<p>My memory of this part is quite blurry, probably because i went blank, realizing how that response wasn't even funny, not sure if anyone even laughed (hasnat maybe?).</p>
									<br><p>Not sure what happened then, but you ran back home, and the girls ran after you. The boys came out of hiding, i had to act like i was unfazed (ego problem hehe). After handing out my autographs, i came to your house. Don't remember half the stuff, but your sister told me to go to your room because you were crying. I said i didn't do anything wrong, it's not my fault. The actual reason i didn't go in was because everyone was there, i actually wanted to talk in private.</p>

I don't remember what we talked about either, but it was an important conversation. We had more privacy there, but i still couldn't be completely transparent with you, for various reasons. One being, the cousins knew we were there, and were observing us from the gate. I think there was a lot i wanted to talk about, the circumstances didn't allow me to.</p>

You had obviously peaked my interest, i wanted your attention, even if i didn't have feelings for you. Even though i acted indifferent, and annoyed, i always got excited when you'd give me attention. I should've realized that was a sign.</p>

									<p>We'd both spend all our free time watching anime/reading. I was watching hunter x hunter around this time, i'd watch it all day. You'd be in the room right next to me, reading all day.</p>

									<p>I never stopped to think whether that life was what i truly wanted. I didn't have anyone i loved, i wasn't capable of love. Stone cold heart, with an equally cold personality.</p>
									<p>I, unironically, planned on staying single until at least 30.</p>

									<p>These 11 months, the only reason i enjoyed sending streaks was because i knew you'd see them. The only streak that would excite me was yours, even though all you sent was a picture of the roof....for almost 2 years....</p>
									<p>Every single one of my streaks was sent with you in mind, it's the only reason i tried to make it somewhat interesting. At the very least, i didn't want you to open my streak and expect a black picture</p>
									<p>This is something i would've liked to talk about with images for reference, but that would take too long. It would've been nice if i got this idea a day before.</p>

									<p>The first time we talked, after years. I was already head over heels for you, but i still held those feelings back, dismissing them as a 'phase'. That was, until i heard your voice. These days were pretty fun for me, i felt truly alive, after a very long time.</p>
									<p>I'm rushing everything from here on. Things happened this month. It was a clusterfuck of emotions for me. Started the month really happy, ended it completely fucked. I'm happy i went through all that, it was a good experience for me. It made me become a much better person. It made me realize i had emotions too. It made me feel human. I'm happy you could give me that support, i'm grateful you were there, even if the situation wasn't what i wanted it to be.</p>

									<p>Anyways march is when i made you watch attack on titan, then april was when most things happened. I was out of my comfort zone most of the time, but it made me grow as a person. I'm happy things turned out so well.</p>

									<p>The next 3 months were the happiest times of my life, it was very different to what i was used to. I did things that i never thought i'd do. I told you things i never thought i'd tell anyone. I showed you things i never thought i'd show anyone.</p>
